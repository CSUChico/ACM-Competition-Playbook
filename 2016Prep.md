## Max Bipartite Matching

The concept of maximum bipartite matching is splitting the vertices into two disjoint sets and solve to maximize the number of vertices from the first subset that are matched to a vertex in the second subset without any sharing of vertices.

Maximum flow can also be used to solve this type of problem, however, maximum bipartite matching will be much faster

## Max flow

Maximum flow requires a source with edges that only point away from the source, and a sink which only has edges that point towards it. The goal of this algorithm is to maximize the flow from the source to the sink. Each edge has a capacity and each vertex has to output as much capacity as it is bringing in. The easiest way to think of this is a water pipe system where edges are pipes and vertices are distribution facilities(or whatever helps the imagery). The goal of the distribution facilities are to split the amount of water coming in among its outgoing pipes, therefore, they cannot store water. In other words you cannot have more water coming in than going out.

## Miller Rabin

Miller Rabin is a primality test. It is very fast but is not 100% accurate

## Min Cost matching

Minimum Cost Bipartite Matching is the process of finding a Maximum Bipartite Match that has the minimum cost among all possible maximum bipartite matches. Basically weighted Maximum Bipartite Matching.

## Min Cost Max flow

Minimum Cost Maximum Flow is the process of finding the minimum cost for all possible maximum flow solutions in a graph. Basically a weighted max flow.

## Primes

Primes is an exhaustive primality test.

## Push Relabel

Regarded as the most efficient Max Flow Algorithm. Can also be applied to graphs with edges in parallel.

## Longest Increasing Subsequence Size (N log N)

The purpose of this algorithm is to use dynamic programming to determine the longest increasing subsequence in a array/list(non contiguous) A.

To do this, we keep an archive of lists. We iterate through A and follow three rules:

1. If A[i] is smallest among all end
   candidates of the archive of lists, we will start
   new archive list of length 1.

   EX. A[i] = 1

   Archive:<br>
   [2]<br>
   [3,5]

   Since 1 is smaller, than all, we create a new list and delete all lists of the same length.<br>
   [1]<br>
   ~~[2]~~<br>
   [3,5]<br>

2. If A[i] is largest among all end candidates of the
  archive lists, we will clone the largest archive
  list, and extend it by A[i].

  EX. A[i] = 7

  Archive:<br>
  [2]<br>
  [3,5]

  Since 7 is larger the both 2 and 5,<br>
  [2]<br>
  [3,5]<br>
  [3,5,7]

3. If A[i] is in between, we will find a list with
  largest end element that is smaller than A[i].
  Clone and extend this list by A[i]. We will discard all
  other lists of same length as that of this modified list.

  EX. A[i] = 4

  Archive:<br>
  [2]<br>
  [3,5]

  Since 2 < 4 < 5, We duplicate and extend [2] and delete all lists of the same length

  [2]<br>
  [2,4]<br>
  ~~[3,5]~~

At the end the longest list is the longest increasing subsequence(non contiguous)

### C++ Implementation (untested)
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Binary search (note boundaries in the caller)
int CeilIndex(std::vector<int> &v, int l, int r, int key) {
    while (r-l > 1) {
    int m = l + (r-l)/2;
    if (v[m] >= key)
        r = m;
    else
        l = m;
    }

    return r;
}

int LongestIncreasingSubsequenceLength(std::vector<int> &v) {
    if (v.size() == 0)
        return 0;

    std::vector<int> tail(v.size(), 0);
    int length = 1; // always points empty slot in tail

    tail[0] = v[0];
    for (size_t i = 1; i < v.size(); i++) {
        if (v[i] < tail[0])
            // new smallest value
            tail[0] = v[i];
        else if (v[i] > tail[length-1])
            // v[i] extends largest subsequence
            tail[length++] = v[i];
        else
            // v[i] will become end candidate of an existing
            // subsequence or
            // Throw away larger elements in all LIS, to make room
            // for upcoming grater elements than v[i]
            // (and also, v[i] would have already appeared in one
            // of LIS, identify the location and replace it)
            tail[CeilIndex(tail, -1, length-1, v[i])] = v[i];
    }

    return length;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v{ 2, 5, 3, 7, 11, 8, 10, 13, 6 };
    std::cout << "Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence is "
    << LongestIncreasingSubsequenceLength(v) << '\n';
   return 0;
}```
